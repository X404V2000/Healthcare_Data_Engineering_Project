# HEALTHCARE DATA ENGINEERING PROJECT
-----------------------------------
This project is based on improving my skills in Python, SQL, data engineering and data governance concepts.

---

## Project Overview
- This project simulates realistic healthcare data from the ground up building synthetic datasets mimicking real-world scenarios in the healthcare industry.
- The data includes sensitive information such as credit card details to help explore and practice data governance and privacy procedures.
- Two datasets are generated:
    1. Public dataset(with anonymized or less sensitive fields)
    2. Private dataset(containing sensitive details, for internal organizational use only) 
- The project is ongoing and currently in development.

---

## Usage
-- Run the notebook to generate datasets.
-- Review data governance and anonymization steps incorporated in the workflow

---

## Future Workflow
- Enhance data anonymization techniques to comply with privacy regulations such as HIPAA.
- Build end-to-end pipelines using generated datasets for healthcare analytics use cases.
- Document data schema and governance policies implemented
